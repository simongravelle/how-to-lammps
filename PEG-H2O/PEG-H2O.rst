Pulling a PEG molecule in water
===============================

Here a single PEG molecule is immersed in water, and forces are applied to its
ends in order to extend it.

Note: The atom_style `full` is required for charged molecules, and the pair_style `lj/cut/tip4p/long`
is a Lennard-Jones (cut) - Coulomb (long) pair style specifically adapted to 4 points water models,
which is what we want here.
